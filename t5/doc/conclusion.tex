\section{Conclusion}

The main goal of this laboratory was achieved once that we were able to architecture a bandpass filter with the provided OP-AMP. This circuit was successfully analyzed using both Ngspice and Octave. 
\par
However, there were some discrepancies between the theoretical and simulation analysis. This error was mainly caused by the presence of non-linear components in the circuit (OP-AMP). This component has an imensity of different parameters that make very hard, if not impossible, to simulate theoretically.
\par 
Despite these differences both models were correctly analysed and both result were satisfatory.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

As one can conclude from observing and comparing the values of the theoretical and the simulation parts of the analysis, there are some glaring differences . This can be due to the fact that the models we are working with are characterized by their non-linearity, which explains the disparity found in our simulation work when compared to the analysis made susing Octave. 

The main reason for these differences is the parameters defined by Ngspice for the used transitors (model BC547A for the NPN junction and model BC557A for the PNP junction). However, the complexity of these parameters makes the simulated model a reliable one that is very close to reality.

Nevertheless, we believe that this laboratory work was rather successful when considering the quality (merit) of the architectured circuit.

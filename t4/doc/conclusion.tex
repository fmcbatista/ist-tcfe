\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

To sum up, in this assignment, the main goal was successfully achieved. This objective was to analyze a circuit with varius components such as resistors, a voltage source that changes over time and a capacitor.

To perform this study we used the Octave and Ngspice tools for the theoretical and simulation analysis, respectively.

The values that were obtained in both analysis are very similar. nevertheless, there are small discrepancies between the sets of values. These differences are due to approximations, made particularly by Ngspice, as this software has a different level of digit precision when compared to Octave. Whereas some values in Octave are presented as 0, in Ngspice the same values are simulated with the order of 1e-14 or 1e-15 which we can consider to be also zero. Therefore the relative error between the theoretical and simulated results are very close to 0\%.

The proximity between the values obtained in the static, time and frequency analysis in the theoretical and simulation section can be explained with the simplicity of the circuit that is only made of linear components and one capacitor.

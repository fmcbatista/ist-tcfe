\par The main goal of this laboratory assignment is to design a circuit of an audio amplifier and to analyse it theoretically, as well as simulating it using Ngspice.
\par To successfully create this circuit we had to architecture the gain stage and the output stage
\par We were also asked to analyse quantitatively the quality of the designed circuit using the Merit expression presented bellow. 

\begin {equation}
	Merit = \frac{VoltageGain*bandwidth}{Cost*CutoffFreq}
	\label{costofmerit}
\end{equation}
